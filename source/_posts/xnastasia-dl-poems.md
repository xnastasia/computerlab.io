**Facebook post poem

I love that moment when technology becomes imperfect, and immediately more sentient. 
when humans scold it as if it were another being
that physical moment
hitting the TV
pulling on your earbuds
tilting the touch ID just right
keeping the throttle open
turning the router on and off
becoming one with the machine
knowing the machine intimately 
being intimate with the machine

![Romantic Radio Wave Surveillance.](/images/asya-spotify.jpg)

The notion of romantic comedy has historically been a thorn in my side. The conflation of romance,
a simple mechanism I prefer to naively fall for time and time again, with comedy, 
a weapon I use to obfuscate episodes of narcissistic depression. The funny aspects of my personality. 
Love, I adamantly believe, deserves to be revered as precious, as it grows from a centre of vulnerability. 
As any carbon based life form, I have trouble with feeling secure in the practice of vulnerability.
This “trouble” at time edges into obsessive self-conduct. I have convinced myself that I am unable to
publish anything online that is in alignment with my emotional state. I have even developed a paranoid fear of 
listening to music in an app I know is being tracked, like Spotify or Apple Music. 
My current practice of "vulnerability" is nothing more than an endlessly oscillation of 
narcissistic fear of emotionless surveillance, that my emotions will be used against me - but this time, 
not by a callous boy, but a shoe company, frozen yogurt chain, or streaming service.
You all saw those creepy Spotify ads, right? 
“Dear person who listened to “Sorry” by Justin Bieber four thousand times: What happened?” 
Yeah, that didn’t feel targeted or creepy at all! 
All you hyper critical vibes kids felt that anxiety before weaponized big data. I did, too. 
That’s a peculiar response for me, particularly since I had a Last.fm account from about 11 years of age which I 
used to meticulously scrobble every single track I had listened to, hoping that someday I would discover
a secret admirer. Someone who'd gone through my entire listening history to create a calendar 
of my emotional states based on what tracks I listened to. 
I never did discover a secret admirer like that. All I got was Spotify. 

**Diary April 2016 (Breakup Playlist Story)

When Dylan and I were seeing each other, I had a fixation of sorts on visiting grocery stores together. 
Really, I romanticized any kind of superstore at the time, marveling at the sheer insanity of it all: 
arbitrary-seeming price stickers floating from product to product, 
goofy package design suggesting long freelancer nights in some faraway Midwestern studio apartment, 
coupons referencing pop culture, elevator music curation, marketing buzzwords. 
How could I not feel fortunate to witness the hilarious, absurd existence of an American superstore? 
I’d lure him into the pet care aisle, squeezing plastic chickens and embarrassing him with loud toy noises 
and my own childlike excitement.
Eventually, I stopped trying to force my excitement of grocery shopping on him. 
He appeared somewhat annoyed with it, and eventually, our relationship came to a lull. 
At some point after our emotions settled, he asked if I wanted to come along with him on a short trip to the supermarket. 
I found the idea of someone else driving me practical, and agreed. We both shopped separately, looking for needed staples. 
There was no arm-in-arm giggling at turkey-shaped butter, or attempts to splash each other with the produce sprinkler. 
At one point, we bumped into each other at the hummus stand, and he played up some excitement about a large tub 
of garlic hummus being an excellent deal. And then I saw it. Here he was, at a grocery store, acting all excited about it. 
About a good deal on hummus. Here he was, grocery shopping with me and being excited, yet I had walked through 
the whole square footage of the place without the elated delirium I was overwhelmed with just a few months prior.

I feel frustrated that this reads like a story about how I fell out of love with Dylan, 
since it’s really a story about how I fell out of love with superstores, 
or perhaps something even larger than that. 
Somehow, this large building that used to feel like a cinematic and dreamlike joke, 
a psychological amusement ride where everything just seems so unreal, as if I could grab into the 
air and it would all dissolve. Somehow, it just became the place where I could satisfy a craving.

**THE SUPERMARKET DOESN'T LOVE YOU

the grocery store is the cyborg’s forest
controlled physically by other cyborgs, controlled ideologically by neoliberalism.

we have dreamed of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, 
watched over by machines of loving grace. 
we wake up to a nightmare of being watched over by an grotesque emptiness extending beyond cctvs 
(crude banksyist representations of surveillance valley,)
where is there that loving grace - is it hidden behind the endless production lines of ever emerging technology?

sans loving grace, a machine is just a machine.  
a machine is separated from questions of morality by nothing more than sheer chance.  

a car becomes an object that can scream and hit things, rather than something that transports.

when we use technology, we are throwing blades at each other, laughing, because to us it’s a entertaining game of frisbee
playing with fire in Y2K.

the modern supermarket is a physical space playing with a virtual negative space 
tracking your ‘consumer behaviour’, the floor plan is ‘enhanced’, essentially
morphing into a cybernetic sea monster that knows more about you
than you could know about the universe yourself

we've terraformed the digital dream jungle to an individualistic, 
isolated experience. Every day it's violent existence tramples over the promise of “staying connected”
does our physical cybernetic ecology have to be the same way?

you go to the grocery store and you’re somewhere else : 
without you, its not the same

that moment when technology becomes imperfect, and suddenly somewhat sentient. 
when humans scold it as if it were another being
that physical moment when
ur hitting the TV
pulling on your earbuds
tilting the touch ID just right
keeping the throttle open
turning the router on and off
becoming one with the machine
knowing the machine intimately 
being intimate with the machine
